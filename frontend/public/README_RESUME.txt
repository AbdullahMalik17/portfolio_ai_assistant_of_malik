IMPORTANT: Add Your Resume PDF Here
=====================================

The portfolio has a "Download Resume" button in the Hero section.

To make it work:
1. Export your resume as a PDF file
2. Rename it to: Abdullah_Malik_Resume.pdf
3. Place it in this directory: frontend/public/
4. Delete this README_RESUME.txt file

The download link is already configured at:
- frontend/app/components/Hero.tsx (line 68-91)
- Path: /Abdullah_Malik_Resume.pdf

Once you add the PDF file, users will be able to download your resume by clicking the "Download Resume" button on your portfolio homepage.
